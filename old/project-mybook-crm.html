                <span class="label">the brief</span>
                <p class="u-mb-1x">As part of Alaias 2018 roadmap, we had planned to release our first mobile application. A slimmed down version of our desktop CRM software MyBook. Jumptools, Alaias main Software-as-a-Service product is also offered as a white-label marketing/business solution to Royal LePage agents. This meant our mobile application would also need to support a "branded" and "unbranded" version.</p>

                <span class="label">what i did</span>
                <p>For this project I worked directly with Alaias principal and lead engineer Richard Ding Au. I was responsible for design and development in this project. That included creating initial design mockups, working through feedback loops and iterations, presenting design milestones to the client.</p>

                <p>MyBook Mobile was built using Cordova.js, Backbone.js and jQuery. This was the second project where I was using Backbone.js at Alaia</p>

                <p>From a development perspective I was responsible for writing and maintaining all of the front-end code including all HTML templates and LESS/CSS files. Outside of design and CSS development I also helped support the back-end needs of the application. Working closely with our lead engineer I helped implement a variety of performance optimizations, data validation and SQL/database management</p>

            <span class="label">challanges i faced</span>
            <p class="u-mb-1x">Our biggest hurdle in this project was major performance bottlenecks. Early on in our process we were able to identify that loading long lists of data was going to cause performance issues on low-powered mobile devices. These problems became even more apparent as we added animation and more DOM elements to our Single Page Application.</p>

            <p>Through quick iteration we were able to experiment with various fixes and tweaks. Using Chrome's extensive DevTools suite I was able to profile and track down various javascript performance hits that weren't needed. I also audited our HTML to see if I could remove any unneeded DOM nodes, especially in list items. These optimizations in combination with limiting page counts and implementing a simple pagination system greatly improved our performance and allowed our hybrid mobile application to function smoothly.</p>
