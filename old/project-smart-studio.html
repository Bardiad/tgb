                <p class="u-mb-1x">As part of our 2016 roadmap Alaia was tasked with creating a new Marketing Studio product for real estate agents. Smart Studio would provide agents with the ability to create new marketing pieces such as listing feature sheets, business cards, online slideshows and more.</p>

                <span class="label">what i did</span>
                <p>As one of my earliest projects with Alaia I was tasked with completing the designs that the previous designer had begun working on. I was also asked to create new user flows and designs that had yet to be created.</p>

                <p>I was also sole front-end developer tasked with working on Smart Studio which meant I was responsible for much of the products development lifecycle including building the various components, creating icons and graphics as needed and implementing CSS best practices.</p>

            <span class="label">challanges i faced</span>
            <p>Smart Studio was built as a new component to an already existing online application (Jumptools). Smart Studio was also very different then the rest of Jumptools at the time. This was particularly an issue for the front-end team as we needed to ensure that new Smart Studio styling did not interfere with the legacy application. Because we had recently switched to LESS as our CSS preprocessor, we were able to leverage LESS import and nesting features to scope our styles to the studio quickly while not affecting legacy css code.</p>

            <p class="u-mt-1x">Ultimately this allowed us to transition much more of our legacy codebase into LESS and has also allowed us to deploy restylings of the application much more quickly and consistently.</p>

            <span class="label">final thoughts</span>
            <p>Working on Smart Studio was my first time working on an application in such a large scale. There were a lot of moving parts and I made a lot of mistakes along the way. As a new developer I wasn't as confident in some of my methods and diving head first into this project really helped me gain that confidence.</p>
